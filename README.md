# sample-app-nodejs

Here in this sample-app-nodejs project i have setup a Node.js server using ECR/ECS on AWS. By codepipeline methodology input code fetched from GitHub and then code is build after that code is deployed on AWS ECS.

This GitHub repository contains sample codes to work with AWS 

This Project build_script directory contains build related script, i.e buildspec.yml file integrated in it. 

Deployment related scripts are incorporated in deployment_scripts directory, i.e appspec.yml file.
